One thing about the current world is that people can decide to be everywhere. With technology, we can all be engaged in matters happening in other parts of the world so far from where we are and also be in touch with people from all over the world.

One very important thing that is greatly overlooked is our need to put ourselves out there and be known. More often than not, we don't want people to know our business, what we are up to and what we do. Ask yourself, what good is it to be very good at something if you are not known for it? Even the Bible talks about how unwise it is to light a candle and put it under a bed.

That ancient wisdom applies directly to our modern lives. Whatever we do, whatever we're good at, we should strive so hard to relentlessly publicize it. That's the only way to get others to know what you're into and what you're good at. The goal should be to **let people think about you whenever your field, industry, or area of expertise is mentioned**. Until people know what you do and what you're good at, you cannot be recommended for anything. People only recommend others based on what they know about them and what they see them to be really good at. Never forget, society pays a lot of attention to whatever you do and put out there.

You should have it in mind: **OBSCURITY IS YOUR BIGGEST ENEMY.** Do everything you can to dominate the space you are in. When you dominate the space, you will be the first person that comes to mind when the topic is mentioned. You should not want to be in a race, you should be at the top of the list of considerations.

If you are in a field that even pays more attention to skills than to one's level of education, you should even be more crazy about being known. Are you a tailor? Well then put your designs and your work out there. Are you a software engineer? Well then, write about what you do, write on topics, work on projects and put them out there. People may mock you for putting yourself out there, but that is a small price to pay. **The alternative is silence and obscurity, and that is a cost no one should be willing to accept.**
